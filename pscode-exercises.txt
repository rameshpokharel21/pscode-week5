// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Create variable number1 and assign first number to number1.
Create variable number2 and assign first number to number2.
Define variable result  and assign (number1 + number2) to result.
Return result.

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Create variable number.
Assign the given number to number.
Create variable result.
Assign "odd" to result.
if number is exactly divisible by 2
	Assign "even" to result.
return result
	

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)
Set num1 to first number.
Set num2 to second number.
Set num3 to third number.
Set num4 to fourth number.
Set num5 to fifth number.

b)
Define variable sum.
Define variable average.
Assign (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) to sum.
Assign sum divided by 5 to average.
Return average.

c)
//for smallest number
Create variables current and min.
Set min = num1.
Set current = num1.
Repeat the following process 5 times:
	if(current < min)
		Set min = current.
	Set current to next number in the list.
Return min.

//for largest number
Create variables current and max.
Set max = num1.
Set current = num1.
Repeat the following process 5 times:
	if (current > max)
		Set max = current.
	Set current to next number in the list.
Return max.

d)
print ("The average of given numbers is", average).
print ("The smallest of given numbers is", min).
print("The larges of given numbers is",max).
